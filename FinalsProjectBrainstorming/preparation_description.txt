Hi Folks @here !

In preparation for our Finals Project Brainstorming Session ( ___  today!)... come prepared to share 
something about yourself. Take a big step back from coding, computers, web applications, and all that.

What is your passion? What areas of Expertise do you have?

One little experiment we'll do is to put people into a random breakout room, and see if each combination of 
three people can find an Intersection between 2 or 3 of the passions in that room, the we'll have folks 
report back to see what that exercise found.

From there, we'll hear 'elevator pitches' from individuals, venture capitalism style. (Think about the 
opening of presentations you'll see on TV shows like Dragon's Den or Shark Tank.)
