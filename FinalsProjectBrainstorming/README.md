1) This session is for brain-storming 'viable' ideas for Finals Projects.

2) What are your personal passions and interests? What is your expertise, your past experience? We can 
start with a trick, where we generate random break-out rooms, and then see if the three people in each 
group can be inspired by the intersection of their interests. (e.g. if an accountant and a construction 
worker end up in a breakout together, one idea would be a webapp that handles accounting for construction 
projects, with pre-built templates for different types of construction project, etc.)

3) After that initial brain-storming, we will do our "Startup Weekend" emulation, where anyone with an 
elevator pitch raises their hand and then they get the floor for a minute, to pitch their idea. For each 
pitch, we arrive at a short phrase that describes the app, e.g. "Tinder for Lawyers/Clients". Students in 
the group should, after the pitches, be likely to connect that phrase with the more detailed pitch.

4) The instructor makes a new Slack Thread, in the cohort's Slack Channel. Everyone who wants to put their 
pitch into the Slack Channel does so. Then, every student has 3 'reactions', the 1 digit, the 2 digit and 
the 3 digit emoticons. Using the honour system, they distribute their 1,2 and 3 throughout the pitches such 
that 1 is their first choice of group to be involved with, 2 their second and so on.

5) We can test whether a Finals Project is 'viable' by seeing how much support there is for it.

6) None of these numbers and 'votes' is binding. Over the next few days, groups can form by speaking with 
each other, and either proposing their membership to pitch owners, or canvasing other students to join 
their pitch. During those few days, there is certainly room for refined or alternative project ideas to 
come forward, and for students to communicate with their cohort mates about those ideas.
