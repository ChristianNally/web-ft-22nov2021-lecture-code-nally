THIS is the Finals Projects Brainstorm "Mega Thread". Pitch people... reply to this thread with your Pitch 
Phrase. Everyone can the put up their :one: , :two: and :three: reactions to choose their first, second and 
third choice of topic. The results of those reactions will show the popular ideas. Note this is just a way 
to get the creative juices flowing for ideas. You may find, even at later stages that you need help finding 
a group and topic. That can be quite common. Also don't worry if your pitch idea doesn't get many votes. 
That doesn't mean that it wouldn't be a good project or business in the future.

Thanks to all of our pitch people!
