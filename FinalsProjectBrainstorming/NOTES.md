Sure. It's a lot of fun actually.

***

Before the session starts, figure out how many students are in that cohort. DivideÂ by 3 and that's the approximate number of projects you're aiming for.

# When the Class Starts

Figure out what % of the students think they're sorted with i) an idea and ii) a group. (I was once surprised to get 15 minutes into it before I figured out that ALL the students had already picked groups. Then there was that other group with ZERO ideas and no social cohesion. It helps to figure out where you stand at the start.)


# Our Process

Tell the story of Startup Weekend and how they convert a room of 100 people into groups for a project. (solicit project 'elevator pitches' from anyone who wants to... be especially encouraging of BAD ideas, given an example, ...) In our version, each elevator pitch is going to end up being posted into a Slack Thread and people in the cohort will 'react' with a :one: , :two: or :three: if that pitch would be their first, second or third preference for a project)

Be sure to lower the stress about the whole process... there's a temptation to think that the process is FINAL and there's sometimes panic as if they don't get onto a group then and there that it'll be difficult and hard to get into one. That's not true. There are ALWAYS last minute ideas and groups forming. It's a multi day process.

The goal of this session is to introduce some ideas to choose from, and how ideas can get formed.

# Before the Pitches ... Tell Them What Makes a Good Project

Emphasize that for any given project it's NOT about the idea itself... it's about the implementation. e.g. every year someone wants to do a recipe website because recipe websites on the web are terrible for having too many ads and sidebars and UI issues. Also, every cohort, someone wants to do a crypto-coin price tracking, signals thing. Just because a site has been done before or its on the web already doesn't mean that you can't make an excellent version of one of those. A great idea is nice, but quality of a project is going to come through via implementation, UI choices, extra functionality, etc.

# Solicit Pitches

After telling people what pitches are like, and maybe giving an example... canvas for how many pitches people are ready to give. If it's high compared to the number you need... then you can get started right away.

# Optional Way to Encourage Ideas

Sometimes the number of initial offered pitches is VERY low, and no one comes forward when you need them to. In such a case the following exercise helps a lot.

Ask every student to choose their one and most important "passion", "expertise", or "interest" (inside or outside of the computing world).

Then do an example with three volunteers. Say you get a trio whose passions are biking, nature and photography. You're looking for a web app that's at the intersection for the three passions... so in this case perhaps a photo sharing app for remote biking trails. (i.e. the app needs maps, a social component, search tool for tagged images, etc.)

If you really need more pitches then you can put people into random breakouts of three people, get them to do the above exercise and then after that, ask for groups that found any good ideas that way.
# Keep Encouraging Until you have maybe 50% more pitches than you need.

A good pitch is SHORT. It gets straight to the idea. Captures the imagination of the people who would enjoy working on that. Sometimes it helps for the instructor to clarify the idea by asking a few leading questions of the person giving the pitch. At the end of each pitch, make sure that each pitch giver has figured out a short punchy phrase that captures the essence of the idea. "Recipe Website with Fridge Inventory Tools", or "Map App to Rank the Best Public Restroom with Social Component", etc. That phrase will be the phrase that's posted into the Slack Channel. The main thing is that everyone one the Zoom should recognize the project idea from the pitch and be able to choose their favourites.

Often, the ideas people will have multiple pitches to give. Ask them to only one pitch at a time, and then get back in the queue.

# Wrap Up The Session

Post the following into their Slack Channel and get the people who made pitches to write their pitch phrase into the THREAD. Then ask people to distribute their :one: :two: and :three: reactions onto the posts.

From there people can reach out to each other, and the pitch person can pick people to be in their groups. Make it clear that if people are having a hard time finding groups, that that happens all the time, and it's fine to form groups a little later in the process, etc.

Then have fun watching as people distribute their reactions through the thread for the next little while.
